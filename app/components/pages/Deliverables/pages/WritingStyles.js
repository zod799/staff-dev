      <h2>Writing Styles</h2>
      <p>This guide has been created to help you in the process of writing and editing material that follows the grammar and style standards for Staff Development. While the general recommendations section does reference certain standards and styles used by the Associated Press, the main purpose is to provide insight into content creation for Robert Half and Protiviti audiences rather than an all-encompassing writing guide. This section covers the style recommendations that are considered applicable to our audiences in general. Audience-specific considerations can be found in the respective pages for Staffing and Protiviti.</p>
      <p>Please remember that this guide reflects the writing style at a certain point in time and will get refreshed as needed.</p>
