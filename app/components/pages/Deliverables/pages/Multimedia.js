      <h2>Multimedia Guidelines</h2>
      <p>The Enterprise Multimedia Training team creates contemporary, innovative training that supports the enterprise. We have developed these guidelines to promote the clear and consistent use of color, type, photography/illustration, writing styles, video, and eLearning standards.</p>
      <p>We believe that powerful eLearning can create real change:
        <ul>
          <li>We identify which type of eLearning will help solve a specific problem</li>
          <li>We replace dry information with challenging activities and scenarios</li>
          <li>We choose the media types that research shows work best</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Our goal is to take a visual approach to instructional design. We use Agile methodology to manage projects. It makes collaboration easy and fluid. EMT is forward thinking, visual, accessible, simple, enthusiastic, passionate, thoughtful.</p>
      <h3>Animation</h3>
      <p>Animation should be meaningful, appropriate, professional and should add value.  Our process is to define, design, prototype, test, refine, implement. Work with other teammates to move animations from a pencil sketch to a meaningful user experience. Do not include anything that flashes, or can be considered a flash, more than two times in any one second (for those prone to seizures).</p>
