      <p>Skillport is a third party application we are currently using to deliver our own Learning content, as well as Skillsoft-created general content.  The LMS (Learning Management System) Skillsoft provides is limited, so we are moving our LMS capabilities into Cornerstone - which we have branded as "MyLearning".  The link to Skillsoft will be phased out, and instead users will go to MyLearning for all Learning initiatives.  We will continue to deliver some of content provided by Skillsoft through MyLearning.</p>
