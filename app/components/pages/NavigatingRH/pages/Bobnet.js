      <p>BobNet is Robert Half's intranet.  To access BobNet, you will need a RobertHalf.com login and either be onsite using the building's network, or connect to the site externally using a VPN application.  This site is created within Sharepoint, and is managed by the Interactive Media Services (IMS) team.  This team is currently in the midst of preparing to deploy a fully re-worked company intranet to replace (and retire) the existing BobNet.</p>
      <p>IMS&apos; <a href='http://connect/rh-wiki/Pages/Global%20Experience%20Style%20Guide.aspx' target='_blank'>Global Experience Style Guide</a> has complete information on how to post content on BobNet and rhConnect.</p>
