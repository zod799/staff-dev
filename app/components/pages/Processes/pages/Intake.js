      <h2>Intake</h2>
      <p>This is a formalized process for the Executive Committee to vet projects suggested/requested by employees ("Clients").  The Client fills out the online "Intake" form (link to form, here?) and submits it.  Members of the ECM review the project and assign departments as necessary.</p>
      <p>Once the Board of Directors reviews the intake submissions and compares them to Managers&apos; resource allocation status, they will asses the relevance and priority of the project, and either pass it along to a manager for a consultation, or request more information from the Client.</p>
      <p>If Staff Development takes on the project, a Lead (and - potentially - a team) will be defined.  That Lead will consult with the Client to teach them a bit more about what we do, and learn all they can about the Client's needs.  This Lead will fill out a Project Charter and iterate on that document with the Client until agreement is reached and the project can launch.</p>
      <p>Upon launch, the Lead will begin <a href='http://staff-development-resources.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/project-management.html' target='_blank'>the project</a> using our various helpful tools - <a href='http://staff-development-resources.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/liquid-planner-projects.html' target='_blank'>Liquid Planner</a> for Project Tracking and Management, <a href='http://staff-development-resources.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tools.html' target='_blank'>Storyline, Adobe Creative Suite</a>, <a href='http://staff-development-resources.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/xyleme.html' target='_blank'>Xyleme</a>, etc.</p>
