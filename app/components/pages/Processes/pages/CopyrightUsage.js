      <h2>Copyright (Usage) Guidelines - Protiviti</h2>
      <p>At the time of this writing, our team best practice is to secure a release form from the subject of photographs, videos and audio recordings. Do not pull photographs from internet or other sources without express release or permission from the subjects of media. Protiviti release forms can be found on the G-drive: \\na\corpshared\Staff Dev\Protiviti Master Docs\Release and consent forms</p>
      <p>“Fair Use” copyright exceptions for educational purposes do not apply to for-profit education or training. Remember that Protiviti provides training for member firms which involve payment to the firm.</p>
      <p>All training products must have the Protiviti copyright with the year created clearly marked and designated for internal use only.</p>
