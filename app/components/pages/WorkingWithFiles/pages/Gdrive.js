      <p>The "G Drive" is actually just a mapped network drive that is typically mapped to the "G" letter on your PC by the IT Department.  The actual drive is referred to as "corpshared", and the address begins with \\na.  You will find a wealth of material on this drive - and your access to any of it is determined by your role.  We typically utilize the Staff Dev folder in this space.  Within this folder there are many other folders that, depending on your role, you may or may not refer to on a daily basis.  For instance - in EMT, we typically use the Person folder, and the EMT/Projects folder.</p>
