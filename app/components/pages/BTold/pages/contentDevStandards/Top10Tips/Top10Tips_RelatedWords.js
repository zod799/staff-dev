      <h2>Keep related words together</h2>
      <p>The position of the words in a sentence is the principal means of showing their relationship. Confusion and ambiguity result when words are badly placed. The writer must, therefore, bring together the words and groups of words that are related in thought, and keep apart those which are not so related.</p>

      <p>In the left-hand version of the first example, the reader has no way of knowing whether the stain was in the center of the rug or the rug was in the center of the room. In the left-hand version of the second example, the reader may well wonder which cost two dollarsâ€”the phone call or the dinner. In the left-hand version of the third example, the reader's heart goes out to those poor fellows frozen in a steel tank.</p>

      <p>Modifiers should come, if possible, next to the words they modify. If several expressions modify the same word, they should be arranged so no wrong relation is suggested.</p>
