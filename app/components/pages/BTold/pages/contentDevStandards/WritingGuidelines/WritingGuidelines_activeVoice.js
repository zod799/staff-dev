      <h2>Use the Active Voice</h2>
      <p className='note'>The following text is from
        <em>The Elements of Style</em>
        by William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White, Fourth Edition, pages 18â€“19.</p>
      <p>The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive:</p>
      <blockquote>I shall always remember my first visit to Boston.</blockquote>
      <p>This is much better than</p>
      <blockquote>My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.</blockquote>
      <p>The latter sentence is less direct, less bold, and less concise. If the writer tries to make it more concise by omitting "by me,"</p>
      <blockquote>My first visit to Boston will always be remembered,</blockquote>
      <p>it becomes indefinite: is it the writer, or some person undisclosed, or the world at large, that will always remember this visit?</p>
      <p>This rule does not, of course, mean that the writer should entirely discard the passive voice, which is frequently convenient and sometimes necessary.</p>
      <blockquote>The dramatists of the Restoration are little esteemed today.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Modern readers have little esteem for the dramatists of the Restoration.</blockquote>
      <p>The first would be the preferred form in a paragraph on the dramatists of the Restoration, the second in a paragraph on the tastes of modern readers. The need to make a particular word the subject of the sentence will often, as in these examples, determine which voice is to be used.</p>
      <p>The habitual use of the active voice, however, makes for forcible writing. This is true not only in narrative concerned principally with action but in writing of any kind. Many a tame sentence of description or exposition can be made lively and emphatic by substituting a transitive in the active voice for some such perfunctory expression as there is, or could be heard.</p>

      <p>Note that in the examples above when a sentence is made stronger, it usually becomes shorter. Thus, brevity is a by-product of vigor.</p>
