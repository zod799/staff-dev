      <p>Effective use of screen shots provides the following user-oriented assistance in understanding the training and applying the results:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>check points as to what should be happening on-screen</li>
        <li>visual descriptions about the steps to take</li>
        <li>results of an action after performing the steps</li>
        <li>quick-scan capabilities to allow "refreshers" for users already familiar with the process</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other kinds of images help to create interest or curiosity about a topic. Specialty images are created to help sell an idea or concept, or help illustrate a point (as with workflow images).</p>
