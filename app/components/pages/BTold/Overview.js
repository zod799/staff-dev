      <h2>Welcome to the Business Technology Styles and Standards Guidebook!</h2>
      <p>This guide has been created to assist you in the process of writing and editing material that follows the grammar and style standards of the Business Technology Learning &amp; Development group.</p>
      <p>The style standards established in this guide follow those used by the Associated Press and RHI.</p>
      <p>In this guide you'll find tips on how to create menus, toolbars, dialog boxes and images. You'll also find guidelines on how to properly use punctuation, action words, numerals.
      </p>
      <p>In addition, this guide features tips on how to design a page - whether it's a two-column job aid in Word or a web-based FAQ site.</p>
      <blockquote>Writing, authoring, editing, copyediting, content development, curriculum development, information development, information design. These terms contain the ideas and processes and procedures that go into producing a piece of information that somebody else can use. It's the ground-up process that starts with an objective, goes through an analysis and development stage, considers various design elements, and ends with an evaluation of effectiveness. But the two most important pieces of this process—at least for the purposes of this guide—are grammar and style at the sentence-paragraph-image level.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>What is grammar? Grammar is the structure of a language. Grammar is the rules used to ensure standardization of communication, explaining how the language should be structured, using various categories. Grammar consists of two main categories: word grammar (<a className='tooltip' title='Parts of Speech' href='javascript:void(0)'>parts of speech <span>construction of phrases, clauses and full sentences, all the way up to paragraphs and full texts</span></a>) and sentence grammar (<a className='tooltip' title='Construction of Text' href='javascript:void(0)'>construction of text <span>content words, containing verbs, nouns, adjective and adverbs; and structure words, containing determiners, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions and interjections</span></a>). While most styleguides briefly discuss the basics of grammar, books devoted to grammar contain the standardized structure for any language and a good reference copy should be on any writer's desk.</blockquote>
      <p>What is style? Style is the manner in which language is written. Style is the "voice" of the writing as seen in syntactical structures, diction, and figures of thought. The largest determinant in style is audience, which affects the writer's diction, the degree of complexity in the syntax, and the use of figures of thought such as metaphor. If the objective is to relay information so that it will be understood, writing style can affect the level of understanding just as much as proper grammar.</p>
      <p>You can have a perfectly grammatical sentence, but have lousy style that hinders understanding. What this guide hopes to accomplish is to define the style standards for content developed at RHI—more specifically for curriculum developers at RHI—with a focus on writing in regards to technology. With these standards defined, the audience will receive a consistent, clear message, whether that message is process or procedure.</p>
