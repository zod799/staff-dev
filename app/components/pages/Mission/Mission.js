      <h2>Welcome to the Robert Half Staff Development Resources site!</h2>
      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>The mission of this site is to be a thorough repository of best practices collected from our current Staff Development pros and used by new members of the Staff Development team.</p>
      <p>We&rsquo;ll call these &ldquo;standards&rdquo;, but they are not often that specific since our work is creative and our output is widely varied.  You&rsquo;ll find less prescriptive &ldquo;Use 20 point Open Sans font for all titles&rdquo;, and more &ldquo;Keep title fonts, sizes, and treatments consistent throughout your piece or your series (ie, Salesforce &mdash all the elements of this initiative should have consistent visual cues throughout, and will include a design doc outlining these specifications)&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>Please bring any questions, concerns, or suggestions to a committee member for review and inclusion in the site. Changes to this site can be made by any member of the Staff Dev Resources Committee.</p>
      <p>Committee Co-Chairs : Eric Tremmel, K.C. Murphy<br />
      Writing Subcommittee Lead : Natalie Lampkin<br />
      Multimedia Subcommittee Lead: Laura Gibson<br />
      Systems Subcommittee Lead: Josh Gilbreath</p>
